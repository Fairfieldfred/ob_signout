## Quick Test Checklist

### iOS Device Testing

- [ ] Build: `flutter run`
- [ ] Add 5 test patients
- [ ] Share ‚Üí **Smart Share** (should recommend AirDrop)
- [ ] Verify AirDrop appears in share sheet
- [ ] Send to another iOS device
- [ ] Import file on recipient device
- [ ] Verify all 5 patients imported correctly

### Android Device Testing

## Common Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Same Platform (Happy Path)
1. Add patients on Device A
2. Tap Share ‚Üí Smart Share
3. See recommended method (AirDrop/Nearby Share)
4. Select recommended method
5. Enter sender name
6. Choose Device B from share sheet
7. On Device B, open .obs file
8. Import patients

**Expected**: Fast, seamless transfer in ~5 seconds

### Scenario 2: Cross-Platform (WiFi)
1. Add patients on iOS device
2. Tap Share ‚Üí Smart Share
3. See "WiFi Transfer" as an option
4. Select WiFi Transfer
5. Enter sender name
6. On Android device: Import ‚Üí Receive via nearby
7. See iOS device in list
8. Tap to connect and transfer

**Expected**: Transfer completes in 1-2 seconds

### Scenario 3: User Cancellation
1. Start transfer (any method)
2. Cancel at sender name dialog
3. **Expected**: Returns to patient list, no error

OR

2. Cancel at method selection
3. **Expected**: Returns to patient list, no error

OR

2. (For native share) Close share sheet
3. **Expected**: App returns gracefully

### Scenario 4: No Patients
1. Delete all patients
2. Try to share
3. **Expected**: Error message "No patients to share"

## Device Setup Requirements

### iOS Devices
- iOS 13 or later (for AirDrop support)
- WiFi enabled
- Bluetooth enabled
- AirDrop receiving enabled:
  - Open Control Center
  - Long press network section
  - Tap AirDrop
  - Select "Everyone" or "Contacts Only"

### Android Devices
- Android 6.0 or later
- WiFi enabled
- Bluetooth enabled
- Location permission granted
- Google Play Services installed and updated
- Nearby Share enabled in Settings

---

## Troubleshooting Tests

### Test 1: AirDrop Not Appearing
**Setup**: Turn off Bluetooth on iOS device
**Action**: Try Smart Share ‚Üí AirDrop
**Expected**: Share sheet still opens, but AirDrop greyed out or missing

**Then**: Turn Bluetooth back on
**Action**: Try again
**Expected**: AirDrop now appears

### Test 2: WiFi Transfer Without Network
**Setup**: Turn off WiFi on both devices
**Action**: Try Smart Share ‚Üí WiFi Transfer
**Expected**: Advertising starts, but discovery fails (expected behavior)

**Note**: Log this as expected - will add better error message in future

### Test 3: Large Dataset
**Setup**: Add 50+ patients (use copy/paste to speed up)
**Action**: Smart Share ‚Üí AirDrop/Nearby Share
**Expected**:
- Dialog shows larger data size
- Transfer may take longer but completes
- All patients import correctly

## Regression Testing

Ensure existing functionality still works:

- [ ] **Share as text** still works
- [ ] **Share as file** still works
- [ ] **Send via WiFi** (old option) still works
- [ ] **Paste data** import still works
- [ ] **Add/edit patient** still works
- [ ] **Delete patient** still works
- [ ] **Filter by type** still works

---

## Performance Benchmarks

Record these times for your test datasets:

| Dataset Size | AirDrop/Nearby | WiFi | Notes |
|--------------|----------------|------|-------|
| 5 patients (~10KB) | ___ sec | ___ sec | |
| 20 patients (~40KB) | ___ sec | ___ sec | |
| 50 patients (~100KB) | ___ sec | ___ sec | |

**Expected**:
- AirDrop/Nearby: 2-5 seconds (nearly instant)
- WiFi: 1-3 seconds

### If Issues Found ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. Document all issues with bug report template
2. Prioritize: Critical ‚Üí High ‚Üí Medium ‚Üí Low
3. Fix critical and high severity issues
4. Re-test
5. Repeat until stable

### Performance Issues
If transfers are slower than expected:
1. Test on different WiFi networks
2. Check device Bluetooth/WiFi signal strength
